# Introduction to ASDM

AI-Supported Development Methodology (ASDM) is a comprehensive approach to software development that leverages artificial intelligence to enhance and streamline the development process. This methodology combines traditional software development practices with AI-powered tools and techniques to improve efficiency, quality, and innovation in software projects.
