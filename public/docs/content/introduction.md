# Introduction to ASDM

AI-Supported Development Methodology (ASDM) is a comprehensive approach to software development that leverages artificial intelligence to enhance and streamline the development process. This methodology combines traditional software development practices with AI-powered tools and techniques to improve efficiency, quality, and innovation in software projects.

## Key Objectives

1. **Enhanced Development Efficiency**
   - Accelerate development cycles through AI assistance
   - Reduce repetitive tasks and boilerplate code
   - Streamline code review and testing processes

2. **Improved Code Quality**
   - Leverage AI for code analysis and optimization
   - Ensure consistent coding standards
   - Identify potential issues early in development

3. **Better Decision Making**
   - Use AI insights for architectural decisions
   - Data-driven development planning
   - Intelligent resource allocation

## Target Users

- Development Teams
- Project Managers
- Technical Leads
- DevOps Engineers
- Quality Assurance Teams
