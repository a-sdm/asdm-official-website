    def execute_qa_process(self):
        steps = {
            'static_analysis': self.run_static_analysis(),
            'unit_testing': self.execute_unit_tests(),
            'integration_testing': self.run_integration_tests(),
            'performance_testing': self.conduct_performance_tests(),
            'security_scanning': self.perform_security_scan()
        }
        return self.generate_qa_report(steps)
```
