# Introduction to ASDM

AI-First System Development Methodology (ASDM) represents a fundamental paradigm shift in software engineering. This methodology transforms the core logic of system development from "designing processes and tools for humans" to "designing processes and tools for AI."

## Methodology Scope

ASDM uses "System" rather than "Software" as its core terminology because it applies not only to software development but also to hardware, embedded systems, large-scale engineering projects, and even non-IT system development. AI's capabilities extend beyond restructuring software development processes to encompass various types of system engineering.

Currently, ASDM is primarily applied in software engineering, but its fundamental concepts and architectural design offer valuable insights for system development across other domains.

## Evolution of Software Development Models

Traditional software engineering centers humans as the primary source of value creation, building entire systems around enhancing developer efficiency. Processes, tools, and standards are all designed to facilitate better human collaboration and ultimately deliver functional software.

In the AI era, the value creation paradigm shifts from human-only to "AI + Human" collaboration. The majority of deliverables are generated by AI, while human roles transition from direct code writing to guiding AI work and making critical decisions (approval or rejection) at key junction points.

This transformation reshapes software development value streams. AI assumes responsibility for most work segments, with humans playing crucial roles at critical connection points: controlling upstream and downstream integration, making key decisions, and providing directional guidance. This necessitates building new value stream systems that adapt to AI-era development characteristics.

| Dimension | Traditional Development Model | AI Collaboration Model |
|---------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Value Creation Entity | Human | AI + Human |
| Primary Output Method | Direct human coding | AI generation with human guidance |
| Human Role | Writing code and documentation | Guiding AI, making critical decisions |
| Tool Design Philosophy | Human-centric, visual interfaces | AI-centric, text-based interaction |
| Knowledge Transfer Method | Documents, images, interfaces | Textual context |
| Value Stream Characteristics | Human-led throughout | AI handles most segments, humans control key points |
| Collaboration Mode | Human-to-human collaboration | Human-AI collaboration, AI-AI collaboration |

## Three Foundational Capabilities

To maximize AI's role in software development, three foundational capabilities must be established. These capabilities create an effective working environment for AI, enabling efficient collaboration with humans.

1. **Contextual Awareness Capability**
   
   Providing AI with appropriate contextual environments. The difference between professional developers and novices lies in their knowledge and experience accumulation, which AI perceives as "context." Building effective context is key to improving AI generation accuracy. Traditional software engineering methods of preserving knowledge and experience (visual interfaces, graphical displays) are unsuitable for AI; AI works better with text-based inputs.

2. **Autonomous Execution Capability**
   
   Providing AI with appropriate toolchains. For AI to directly participate in development and solve practical problems, AI-generated content must be transformed into deliverable outcomes. Traditional software engineering tools designed for human use with visual interfaces are unsuitable for AI; AI excels with command-line tools and prefers text-based logging information.

3. **Self-Iteration Capability**
   
   Maintaining project state synchronization and tool adaptation. Once these foundational capabilities are established, they must be continuously updated as projects evolve to accommodate changes and ensure sustained system effectiveness.

These three capabilities work in coordination to create an appropriate working environment for AI, enabling AI to assume responsibility for most output tasks and forming an AI-first software development methodology.

## Capability Architecture

The ASDM framework categorizes capabilities into **Foundational Capabilities** and **Scenario Capabilities** based on their scope of coverage.

Foundational capabilities span the entire software lifecycle, providing universal support. These three foundational capabilities support scenario-specific capabilities, offering standardized context, tools, and improvement mechanisms for each scenario.

Scenario capabilities focus on specific segments of the software lifecycle. ASDM integrates AI capabilities required for each scenario into corresponding workspaces through toolkits: coding scenarios correspond to IDEs, requirements analysis corresponds to requirements tracking systems, and operations troubleshooting corresponds to operations management systems. This design extracts common problems from different development processes and provides solutions within various workspaces.

## AI-Enabled Scenarios

Once foundational capabilities are established, every aspect of software development can receive AI support, improving work efficiency. ASDM's value manifests in AI directly executing specific development tasks: writing requirements documents, generating code, designing test cases, building CI/CD pipelines, conducting code reviews, and more.

These AI-led development tasks are called **AI-Enabled Scenarios**, each representing an independently deliverable, quantifiable efficiency improvement unit. ASDM's goal is to produce more AI-enabled scenarios and enhance effectiveness within each scenario.

ASDM effectiveness is evaluated using two metrics: the number of AI-enabled scenarios and the efficiency improvement magnitude of individual scenarios.
