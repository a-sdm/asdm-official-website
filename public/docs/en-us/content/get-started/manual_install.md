## Manual Installation

If you prefer more manual control over the installation process, you can follow these steps:

### Prerequisite: Check Node.js Environment

Before installation, ensure that Node.js and npm are installed:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

**Expected Result**:
- Node.js version 16 or higher
- npm version information should display normally

**If not installed**: Please install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/, or use package managers such as `nvm`, `apt`, `brew` to install.

### Install from NPM

Install ASDM Bootstrapper CLI globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @leansoftx/asdm-bootstrapper-cli
```

**Expected Result**: The CLI tool has been installed globally, and the `asdm` command is now available.
